        Hot january transfer for 2026
      </h1>
      <p>
        Ghana winger Antoine Serlom Semenyo is one of the greatest prayer who has better performance this season.
        Bournemouth winger Antoine Semenyo has chosen Manchester City as his preferred January destination, according to David Ornstein.
        A turbulent 24 hours have culminated in the 25-year-old making his final choice ahead of the upcoming window.
        The Athletic reported on Tuesday Chelsea had decided against pursuing a move for Semenyo, 25, after making an initial enquiry.
        Semenyo’s desire to win trophies is key to his wish to join Pep Guardiola’s side.

        As yet nothing formal has been agreed, with the January transfer window not open for another week.
        Manchester United also tried their best to sign the forward, but a move in January was always going to be a stretch and the club only wished to bring in players who are eager to join.
        The decision was not due to Ruben Amorim’s system, with United never planning to play Semenyo at wing-back.
        Bournemouth sold several key players in the summer following a successful 2024-25 season under Andoni Iraola.

        Centre-back Dean Huijsen moved to Real Madrid in May when the La Liga club capitalised on a £50m clause. Bournemouth also sold left-back Milos Kerkez, central defender Illia Zabarnyi and winger Dango Ouattara.
        A year earlier, Dominic Solanke, who himself had a £65m exit provision, left to join Tottenham.
        Semenyo has made 106 appearances for Bournemouth since signing from Championship side Bristol City in January 2023, recording 30 goals and 13 assists.
      </p>
      <div>
        <img src="/semenyo1.jpg" alt="image" />
      </div>
      <p>
        The Ghana international was valued at £70m by Bournemouth in the summer, but the sale price for the winter is now formally set at £65m. It must be activated by a specific date,
        which would give Bournemouth a couple of weeks to replace their best player, and is available to any team.
        If he remains with the club in January, the mechanism will again be available once the subsequent transfer window opens, at an even lower figure.
        A hallmark of every Pep Guardiola team has been incisive wide players who can eliminate opponents in one-versus-one situations and contribute double figures in goals.

        As much as Jeremy Doku looks to be improving his end product, Guardiola admitted in his press conference after the 3-0 win against Liverpool that it is unlikely the Belgium winger will ever be one of City’s top scorers.

        Savinho and Oscar Bobb do not quite have the killer instinct in the final third yet, either. It means City have not quite replaced the output of Riyad Mahrez, or even Leroy Sane and Raheem Sterling.

        The reliance on Erling Haaland has become pronounced, and Semenyo would offer a direct threat from either wing, improving City on the counter-attack.

        City are developing into title contenders. Adding Semenyo would be a statement, the arrival of a peak-age player who could be relied upon to be a match-winner.

      </h1>
      <h1>Why Christiano Ronaldo is not happy after Real Madrid sacked Xavi Alonso.</h1>
      <p>
        Xabi Alonso was dismissed as Real Madrid head coach shortly after a Spanish Super Cup final loss to Barcelona and internal tensions within the squad.
        Coverage and reactions have largely focused on Alonso’s own comments, media analysis, and reactions from some players.
        Alonso himself issued a farewell statement saying he left with “respect, gratitude and pride” after his tenure did not go as planned.
        Xabi Alonso released his own public farewell message, saying that his time at Real Madrid “hasn’t turned out the way we hoped”, and that coaching the club has been “an honor and responsibility.” He thanked the club, players, and fans.
        reactions from various figures, but no reputable news outlet has published a direct statement from Ronaldo on this matter yet.
        Ronaldo’s silence speack a lot as his formal team mate has been sacked.
      </p>
      <h2>Why 2026 transfer windows has become complecated for C.Ronaldo.</h2>
      <p>
        Cristiano Ronaldo is the first men’s soccer player to record 900 career goals.
        He currently plays for the Portuguese national team and the Saudi Arabian club Al-Nassr.
        Al Nassr can’t sign new players until FIFA lifts the ban—it’s indefinite for now. Cristiano Ronaldo’s immediate prospects don’t change, but the squad could weaken if injuries or suspensions hit.
        Expect less movement in the January window for Al Nassr than usual.
        “The FIFA Registration Ban List is a vital resource for the football community, detailing clubs worldwide that currently face registration bans imposed by FIFA.”
        This isn’t just Al Nassr’s problem. Several major Saudi clubs—including Al Shabab and Damak—are also on FIFA’s list. Even beyond Saudi Arabia, big names like Corinthians in Brazil and Boavista in Portugal are locked out as well.
        That tells you how strict and global FIFA is getting over regulatory and financial rules.
        Soccer superstar Cristiano Ronaldo has confirmed his legendary career is drawing to a close,
        saying he will likely retire in one to two years.
        Ronaldo, 40, told CNN on Tuesday the 2026 World Cup, co-hosted by the United States, Canada, and Mexico, will “definitely” be his last.
        He also affirmed his plans to retire “soon” and detailed a possible timeline.

      </p>

      </div>
      <p>
        Once the Portuguese national team guarantees its World Cup berth—which could happen as early as this week—Ronaldo is set to become the first male player to ever appear in six different tournaments.
        Portuguese soccer superstar Cristiano Ronaldo is one of the greatest athletes in the sport’s history, winning the Ballon d’Or five times and becoming the first player to score 900 career goals. Considered a phenom as a teenager, 16-year-old Ronaldo signed with Manchester United in a record deal for a player of his age. He set a franchise record for goals scored in 2008, before transferring to Real Madrid the following year. He has since played for Italian Serie A club Juventus and is currently on the Al-Nassr FC squad in Saudi Arabia.
        Among his many accomplishments, Ronaldo led his home country to an emotional victory in the 2016 European Championship.
        In August 2024, the star athlete said he plans to retire with the team within a couple years. But come May 2025, Ronaldo posted a cryptic social media message suggesting he was looking to sign with another club. Perhaps it was just a negotiation tactic. A month later, the club announced via the social media site X that Ronaldo had signed a two-year extension. “I’m happy, two years more. I want to fight with the best teams in Saudi [Arabia] to win the league,” he said in a video statement. According to reports, the deal is worth as much as $468 million per year.
      </p>

      </div>
      <p>
        World cup has become the most wonted trophy for C.Ronaldo as he keeps eye on 2026 World cup ,
        the world is watching if he can make any magic to lift it for Portugal.
        Ronaldo had turned heads with a mesmerizing performance with Portugal against Manchester United, wowing even his opponents with his footwork and deft skill. He made such an impression that a number of United players asked their manager to try and sign the young player, which the team soon did.

        In 2001, Manchester United paid more than £12 million to sign Ronaldo, then just 16 years old. The deal, worth more than $14 million U.S. dollars, was a record fee for a player of his age.

        Ronaldo didn’t disappoint: He showed his promise early on in the 2004 FA Cup final, scoring the team’s first three goals and helping them capture the championship. In 2007, Ronaldo signed a five-year, £31 million contract.

        A year later, Ronaldo again justified his high salary when he put together one of the club’s finest seasons in history, setting a franchise record for goals scored (42) and earning himself the FIFA World Player of the Year honor for 2008.
        In all, Ronaldo helped steer Manchester United to three Premier League titles.
        Let me break down why this ban matters. Al Nassr can’t bring in new players—so forget any winter reinforcements or immediate fixes for injuries or tactical gaps. For Jorge Jesus, the head coach, this is a tactical headache and potentially a reputational one too, especially with Ronaldo front and center.

        Key Developments That Changed the Game
        FIFA updated its Registration Ban List on Friday, adding Al Nassr with suspension starting December 19.
        No date given for the end of the ban—FIFA says it lasts “until lifted.”
        No details released on the specific infraction prompting the latest ban.
        This follows a similar sanction in July 2023, which Al Nassr resolved by paying about $2.3 million.
        Al Nassr isn’t alone: Over a dozen Saudi clubs, plus big names globally, are also barred from registering players.

        Put into action with the Olympic national team during the victorious tournament in Beijing 2008
        He took part in the 2006 World Championship, albeit recovering from an injury. He made his debut in the second group game, played against Serbia, where he came on in the 74th minute replacing Maxi Rodríguez, becoming the youngest player to represent Argentina in a World Cup.
        After a few minutes he provides Hernán Crespo with the winning assist and also scores the final goal of the 6-0 victory.
        World Cup 2014
        The new coach Alejandro Sabella also decides, like his predecessor, to confirm Messi as captain of the Albiceleste.
        [213] The 2014 World Cup qualifying process began with a 4-1 win against Chile, a victory to which Messi contributed with a goal.
        [214] Subsequently Messi managed to score for six consecutive games, scoring 10 goals that allowed him to equal the record previously belonged to Hernán Crespo.
        [215] On 15 June 2013, in the friendly against Guatemala, he overcame Maradona and joined Hernán Crespo as the second highest scorer of the national team with 35 goals, behind only Batistuta (56 goals).
        The brace on 10 September 2013, in the 2-5 away win against Paraguay, allowed him to surpass Crespo as well. [216] Despite Messi's absence, Argentina still qualified first in the World Cup qualifying group,
        in which the Flea would be the second best scorer with 10 goals behind Uruguayan Luis Suárez (11 goals).
        The coach José Pekerman called him up to the senior national team and made him debut on August 7 against Hungary: entered in the 64th minute, Messi left the field in tears after only 40 seconds, expelled by the referee, the German Markus Merk, for an elbow to defender Vilmos Vanczák,
        who clung to his shirt.
        In 2016 he was called up for the Copa América Centenario, which, being a celebratory edition, is played in the United States of America. [222] In this competition, where he had not been able to score a goal from open play for almost 9 years,
        despite resting the first game due to an injury that was not completely overcome, he took over during the game and scored a hat-trick in the 5-0 inflicted on Panama valid for the second day.
        [223] During the quarter-finals, in the match against Venezuela, he scored the goal of the momentary 3-0, thus hooking Gabriel Batistuta at the top of the all-time scorer ranking with the Albiceleste shirt, stopped at 54 goals.
        [224] He repeated himself a few days later, scoring one of the 4 goals with which Argentina qualified for the final by defeating the United States hosts and thanks to which he landed, alone, at the top of the list of scorers of the Argentine Selección.
        [225] As in the previous edition of the Copa América, Argentina found themselves against Chile in the final: after a 0-0 draw in regular and extra time, Messi missed the first shot from the penalty spot on penalties and the Albiceleste lost from eleven meters 4-2. [226]

        At the end of the match, Messi announced his retirement from the national team,[227] but after a conversation with the new coach Edgardo Bauza, the player decided to return to wear the Selección shirt.

        He played with Argentina in the 2024 Copa América, held in the United States. He won every game starting from the group stages, sitting on the bench only once, but scoring only in the semifinals.
        He won his second Copa América and went out in the final due to an ankle injury. He thus confirms himself as the player with the most trophies won in history (45), ahead of Dani Alves (44).
        2026 World Cup Qualifiers
        On the occasion of the 2026 World Cup qualifying match against Peru, Messi served the assist for the final 1-0 scored by Lautaro Martínez, thus equaling the record for assists in the history of national teams (58),
        held by the American Landon Donovan; [262][263][264] record that he will break in the friendly match against Puerto Rico following the Qualifiers, reaching 60.

        [266] In addition, with 36 total goals scored in World Cup qualifying, he is the all-time CONMEBOL top scorer and third overall.
        On 28 March 2023, he scored a hat-trick in the 7–0 friendly win against Curaçao, which allowed him to reach 102 goals scored for the national team; at the same time he became the third footballer to score 100 goals with his nation after Cristiano Ronaldo and Ali Daei.
        [258][259] On 15 June 2023, in a 2–0 friendly win against Australia, he scored after 79 seconds of play, scoring the fastest goal of his career.

        [25][26] The latter club convinced him, after being one step away from Caen,[27] to enter its youth training center in La Turbie.
        [28][29] With the Monegasque youth team he won the Gambardella Cup in May 2016, beating Lens 3-0 in the final with his personal brace and Irvin Cardona's goal.
        On 12 April, he scored his first brace in the Champions League, in the first leg of the quarter-finals against Borussia Dortmund at the Signal Iduna Park, which gave his team a 3–2 victory.
        [41] He also scored in the return match won 3-1 by the Monegasques, who managed to qualify for the semi-finals of the same competition. [42] Despite being eliminated against Juventus,
        he managed to score the only goal for Monaco in the return match at the Juventus Stadium, becoming the youngest player to score in a Champions League semi-final. [43] On 17 May 2017, together with Monaco,
        he was able to celebrate the victory of the national championship,
        which represents his first professional title.
        On 31 August 2017 he went on loan to Paris Saint-Germain with the right to buy for the Parisians. [45] The agreement between the two clubs for the permanent transfer is reached on the basis of €145 million plus €35 million in bonuses,
        a figure that makes the French the second most expensive signing ever behind teammate Neymar. [46][47][48][49] On 9 September, on his debut with the new shirt, he contributed with a goal and an assist to the 5–1 victory at Metz.
        Four days later, he also made his debut with a goal in the Champions League, in the 5-0 away win against Celtic. He finished the group stage of the top continental competition with 4 goals and 3 assists. His experience in this edition of the Champions League ended in the round of 16 due to the defeat against Real Madrid (3-1 first leg and 1-2 second leg).
        On 17 February 2018, Paris Saint-Germain beat Strasbourg 5-2 and climbed to 68 points in the standings: as a result of a clause contained in his purchase contract and linked to the mathematical salvation of the Parisians, the redemption of Mbappé from Monaco became mandatory. [50] On 31 March he won his first trophy with the PSG shirt, the League Cup,
        beating his former Monaco teammates in the final (3-0). [51] He also ended the season by winning the French championship and the French Cup,
        totaling 21 goals in 44 appearances.

        In March 2017 he was called up for the first time to the senior national team by the French coach Didier Deschamps, for the 2018 World Cup qualifiers against Luxembourg and the friendly against Spain, respectively on 25 and 28 March. He made his international debut against the Luxembourgers,
        replacing Dimitri Payet in the 78th minute. The first goal came on August 31, 2017 in the World Cup qualifying match against the Netherlands. [87]

        Called up for the final phase of the World Cup in Russia,[88] he scored the decisive goal in the second match of the French national team, won 1-0 over Peru.
        [89] On 30 June, he scored twice in France's 4–3 win over Argentina in the round of 16, as well as earning a 1–0 penalty from Antoine Griezmann.
        [90] He also scored in the final in Moscow,
        becoming the second teenager, after Pelé, to score a goal in a World Cup final.
        [91] France won 4-2 over Croatia, thus becoming world champions. [92] At the end of the competition he was also named best young player of the tournament. His victorious participation in the World Cup allowed him to earn the sum of 500,000 euros in prizes from the federation,
        which he decided to donate to charity.
        On 13 November 2021, on the occasion of the 8-0 success against Kazakhstan in the 2022 World Cup qualifiers, he scored a quadruple, becoming the first to do so with the French national team since Just Fontaine, who scored four goals in 1958. [98][99] After contributing another goal in the Qatar 2022 qualifying rounds,
        he contributed a goal and an assist in the 4–1 win against Australia in the finals,
        [100] then scored twice in the 2–1 win against Denmark[101] and two more goals in the 3-1 win against Poland in the round of 16. [102] He did not score either in the quarter-finals or in the semi-finals, but he scored a hat-trick in the final against Argentina.
        Only the Englishman Geoff Hurst at the 1966 World Cup had managed to score three goals in a World Cup final. [103] The match, which ended 3-3 after extra time, saw all the goals of the French scored by Mbappé,
        who also scored the first penalty shot,[104] a series in which France was beaten 2-4. At the end of the tournament he won the Silver Ball as the second best player of the event and the Golden Boot as the best scorer, thanks to the 8 goals scored.
        On 5 September 2025, on the occasion of the 0-2 success at Ukraine, he scored the second goal of the French team, tying Thierry Henry into second place in the scorer rankings of his national team with 51 goals scored.
        [118][119] Four days later he overcame it by scoring in a 2–1 win against Iceland.
        On 16 May 2024 he was included in the list of those called up for the European Championships in Germany. [110] During the tournament, which ended with a semi-final defeat to Spain for the French (2–1),[111][112] he scored only one goal in the 1–1 group stage draw against Poland,
        [113] providing overall a performance below expectations. [112][114][115] In 2025 he participated in the final phase of the 2024–2025 UEFA Nations League, scoring two goals: the first in the semi-final lost 5–4 to Spain (the momentary 4–1 defeat of the Iberians),
        [116] the second in the victorious final for third place against Germany (the momentary 1-0, then ended 2-0)

        Bruce Gersh, president of the Meredith entertainment division, which includes both EW and People, said that the cutback in print would be accompanied by deeper 24/7 digital coverage. Entertainment Weekly would still produce weekly digital "covers" and push into podcasts, and planned events and experiential offerings with stars and festivals.[11]

        JD Heyman, deputy editor of People, replaced Henry Goldblatt as editor. As a result of the change, about 15 people were cut. Previous owner Time Inc. spent $150 million developing EW after its February 1990 launch, and was rewarded for its patience when the magazine made a six-figure profit at the end of 1996, and in its peak years was cranking out $55 million in annual profit.[11]

        Though still profitable before the switch to being monthly, EW was squeezed in recent years as celebrity coverage exploded across all platforms, and print advertising shrank. While still called a "weekly" before the switch, it was publishing only 34 issues a year. Meredith, after completing its $2.8 billion acquisition of Time Inc., considered selling the title, along with several others,
        but was convinced to keep EW in part because it was so intertwined with top money-maker People.[11]

        On August 2, 2021, the site of the Greek edition of the magazine was launched, Greece being the first country outside the U.S. in which the magazine would be available.

        On February 9, 2022, Entertainment Weekly ceased print publication and moved to digital-only.[12] The final print issue was that of April 2022.[13] In May 2022, executive editor Patrick Gomez stepped into the editor-in-chief/general manager role.
